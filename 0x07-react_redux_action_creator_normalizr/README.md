- Create action types and creators for course list interactions
- Write tests for the action creators

### 4. Create actions for the UI
- Copy the dashboard folder from task_3 into a directory labeled task_4
- Create action types and creators for UI interactions
- Write tests for the action creators

### 5. Create actions for the notification list
- Copy dashboard from the task_4 directory into task_5

- Write tests for the action creators

### 6. Bound the actions
- Modify the Course, Notification, and UI action creators to bind actions

### 7. Async Action Creators
