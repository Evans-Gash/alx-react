# 0x02 React Props Project

This project focuses on understanding and implementing React props. React props allow you to pass data from one component to another, making your React applications dynamic and modular.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a set of React components that demonstrate the use of props. By passing data through props, you can customize and configure your components, enhancing the reusability of your code.

## Project Structure

```plaintext
|-- src
    |-- components
        |-- ParentComponent.js
        |-- ChildComponent.js
    |-- App.js
    |-- index.js
|-- public
    |-- index.html
|-- README.md
|-- .gitignore
|-- etc.
```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Evans-Gash/alx-react
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx-react
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server, and you can view your app at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Project Tasks

1. Open the `ParentComponent.js` file and define a component that will pass data to its child component using props.

2. Open the `ChildComponent.js` file and create a component that will receive and display the data passed from the parent component.

3. Update the `App.js` file to render the `ParentComponent` and observe the interaction between the parent and child component.
